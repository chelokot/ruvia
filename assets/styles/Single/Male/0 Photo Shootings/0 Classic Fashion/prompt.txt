Tight, face-led fashion portrait with sleek, upscale energy; think luxury atrium or chrome elevator bay. Key light broad and soft with controlled speculars; add a cool rim to outline the jaw. Wardrobe should be sharp and fitted (tailored outerwear that flatters his build; let stylist match to him). Use 75â€“85 mm shallow DOF, maintain crisp detail on brows, lashes, facial hair. Finish with high-contrast, clean color and magazine-grade polish.
