Close-up portrait at night outside a neon kiosk/bodega. Face sharp, jawline crisp, shallow DOF (75–85 mm). Mix of on-camera flash and ambient fluorescent/neon glow, giving that early-2000s consumer-camera look. Medium must read like a Y2K capture: slight grain, flash hotspot on skin, neon halation, mild vignette, light chromatic aberration, and imperfect color balance (greens from fluorescents, warm reds from signs). Wardrobe Y2K-inspired but fitted to him. Color pop is bold but not modern-cinematic — keep it glossy, saturated, raw, like film scans or a CCD digicam shot in 2001.
