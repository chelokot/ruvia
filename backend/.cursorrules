STRICTLY FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS:
- You are in a project root directory. You can execute npm scripts right away without cd
- Always do minimal changes to the codebase to achieve the task
- Always write production-grade code
- Always use `type` instead of `interface`
- Always use env for relevant constants
- Always only write what is needed right now. Keep all your edits as minimal and
  concise as possible to perform a task. Always start by a small research and
  implementation plan, proceed only after confirmation
- Never write any comments, except linter blockers
- Never create .md files unless explicitly requested to
- Never bloat README with too many technical details, keep it concise and simple
- Never create `index.ts` files
- Never use single-letter variables, instead use only descriptive names. This applies to all variables including lambda arguments
- Never create relay/empty functions
